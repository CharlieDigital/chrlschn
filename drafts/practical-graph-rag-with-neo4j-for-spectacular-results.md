## Summary

- "Vanilla" embedding-based RAG is a great start for feeding relevant context into an LLM
- However, it can come up short in certain scenarios
- More advanced techniques are necessary to improve retrieval to find better matches to the search concept
- Neo4j is a graph database that provides a powerful foundation to build a graph-based RAG approach
