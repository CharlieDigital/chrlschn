## Summary

Getting state and componentization right in the frontend remains one of the biggest challenges as modern web applications increase in complexity.  The `defineModel` macro released with Vue 3.4 provides a streamlined way to think about how to model complex, inter-component state management that still retains strong locality and compartmentalization of data

**The full sample code is in this GitHub Repo: https://github.com/CharlieDigital/vue3-state-definemodel**

## Intro

Understanding placement of state and component boundaries remains one of the major challenges in modern frontend web development and is often one of the most important decisions teams can make that can either accelerate development as the scale of an application increases or become the biggest source of friction.

When done right, it makes building, composing, refactoring, and testing frontend components a breeze.  When done poorly, it can be the endless source of phantom bugs that can be difficult to trace and make the codebase feel fragile.

The `defineModel` macro -- released from its experimental status with [Vue's 3.4 release](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-4) -- is perhaps one of the more game-changing features when it comes to how it can shape the way teams think about and implement complex state interactions between different components.

The description seems quite innocuous:

> `defineModel` is a new `<script setup>` macro that aims to simplify the implementation of components that support v-model

On the surface, this macro's utility seems subtle, but it has a *profound* effect on how teams can think about state and managing component boundaries.  Let's take a look at what `defineModel` does and why its addition in Vue 3.4 *feels like a paradigm shift* -- even though it's just a simple macro.

---

## Frontend State Models at a Glance

In general, there are 3 scopes of state when we think about modern frontend applications (excluding `window` level truly global state).

1. **Global, shared state**.  This is state that is accessible across different components within the entire hierarchy.
2. **Hierarchical component state**.  This is state that is accessible across different components within a subtree of the hierarchy.
3. **Single component level state**.  This is state that is accessible only within a single component within a hierarchy.

*(We'll examine these a bit more in a moment)*

At the global level, there are many libraries and solutions for solving this.  For example, React's Zustand, Jotai, Recoil, Redux (among others) and Vue's Pinia help pull state *out* from the component tree into a global scope to cut across the tree.

This second layer of state is where teams encounter the friction of "prop drilling" -- whether in React, Vue, or other libraries or frameworks.  Part of it is that it is onerous to manage moving state up and down this tree between components.  The natural decision teams make in this case is to move state out into a global store instead to make it easier.  But `defineModel` has a game changing effect on how teams can simplify managing this type of state without pulling it out into global state.

## What is `defineModel`?

It's important to first understand what it is and what it does.  For those unfamiliar with Vue, the idiomatic model of moving state up and down between components uses the pair of `props` and `emits`.

### Before `defineModel` - `props` and `emits`

For example, consider this parent-child component:

![Example 1 component](/public/img/vue34-model/example1.png)
*The outer component defines the ref which gets passed down into the child as a prop.  The update occurs through an emit from the child to the parent*

To get the two way binding, we need the inner `NameInput.vue` component to look like this:

```html
<!-- NameInput.vue -->
<template>
  <LabeledContainer label="NameInput.vue">
    <!-- ðŸ‘‡ Bind it here to our input -->
    <input v-model="name"/>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
// ðŸ‘‡ Enters as a prop
const props = defineProps<{
  modelValue: string
}>()

// ðŸ‘‡ Emit the update to the parent
const emits = defineEmits<{
  'update:modelValue': [string]
}>()

// ðŸ‘‡ A writable computed to tie it together.
const name = computed({
  get() {
    return props.modelValue
  },
  set(val) {
    emits('update:modelValue', val)
  }
})
</script>
```

And the outer `Example1.vue` component:

```html
<!-- Example1.vue -->
<template>
  <LabeledContainer label="Example1.vue">
    <h1>Example 1</h1>
    <p>Hello, {{ name.length === 0 ? "(enter your name below)" : name }}</p>
    <!-- ðŸ‘‡ Here is our component -->
    <NameInput v-model="name"/>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const name = ref('')
</script>
```

Now when we type a value into the text box, this automatically updates the value of the prop:

![Example1 in action](/public/img/vue34-model/example1.gif)

It's easy to see how this boilerplate can become tedious!

### After `defineModel` âœ¨

With the release of `defineModel` in Vue 3.4, let's look at how this simplifies `NameInput.vue`:

```html
<!-- NameInput.vue -->
<template>
  <LabeledContainer label="NameInput.vue">
    <input v-model="name"/>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
  // ðŸŽ‰ Just a single line!
const name = defineModel<string>({ required: true })
</script>
```

The parent component remains unchanged, but a large volume of boilerplate code has been removed!

## What's the Big Deal?

On the surface, this seems quite a trivial change.  Sure, some convenience has been gained, but how does this really affect how developers manage state?  Isn't it preposterous to claim so when it's just a simple macro?

The reality is that developers tend to take the path of least resistance and if the path of least resistance is one of bad practices then, well, developers ***will*** create a codebase with many, many bad practices -- AKA "Tech Debt". If you've seen a 1000+ line React or Vue component (*and who among us hasn't?*), then the likely reason is that there was simply too much friction in parceling out the state in a manageable way as the component grew organically; it was easier to just keep sharing the same state than to break out a new component.

What `defineModel` does is it creates a path of least resistance that also happens to help improve how teams can think about state.  Suddenly, that middle ground of managing hierarchical component state becomes trivially easy and removes the temptation to move state into a global scope.

Before we dive into how, I think it's useful to think about a conceptual model of state, components, and where to create boundaries.

### A Conceptual Model of State

If we revisit our list of state scopes, it's instructive to think about what we *ought* to put into each scope in concrete terms.  Generally, there are 3 scopes where state can be placed in a component hierarchy:

1. **Global state**.  Truly global state like user account information; information shared between different routes.
2. **Hierarchical state**.  A grouping of state within a component subtree; typically within a single route. Like a summary-detail editor view.
3. **Single component state**.  The state relevant to a single, standalone component where the state interaction does not bubble out of the component nor need to go down into a sub component.

![A diagram showing a model of component state](/public/img/vue34-model/state.png)

While global state certainly has its use cases -- for example the state of the logged in user or light/dark mode or the currently selected tenant -- it's easy to see that it can be abused as a "cure all" when there is a need to manage shared state in a hierarchical manner beyond one or two levels deep.

Component state is simple: if a control is fully self-contained with no dependencies on its siblings nor ancestors, then there is no need to think about how to share that state between the different components; we just keep all of the state and mutations inside of the component.

But hierarchical state is the most interesting because this maps to common scenarios where it would be nice if it were *easy* to separate state without the friction and pain of prop drilling while maintaining Vue's reactive two way binding.  This is precisely where `defineModel` comes into play as it *dramatically* reduces the friction of prop drilling.

### Using `defineModel` to Simplify Hierarchical State

Consider the following simple contact management app:

![Example 3](/public/img/vue34-model/example3.png)
*Note the hierarchy of components and the two clear subtrees.*

Take note of the hierarchy in this example.  When a user selects a contact from `Listing.vue`, the app should show the details in `Details.vue`.  When the user edits the details and save the changes in `Details.vue`, the app should update the entry in `Listing.vue`.

If we want to share state between `Listing.vue` and `Details.vue`, it has to either be global state or hierarchical state that starts from the common parent `Example3.vue`.

In this case, this is what our hierarchical state looks like:

![Example 3 annotated](/public/img/vue34-model/example3-annotated.png)
*The distribution of state into the contact component is via a prop from the listing*

Let's examine the code from the outside in.

Here is our parent `Example3.vue` component:

```html
<template>
  <LabeledContainer label="Example3.vue">
    <h1>Example 3</h1>

    <p v-if="!!selectedContact">
      Selected: {{ selectedContact.name }} ({{ selectedContact.handle  }})
    </p>

    <div class="parent">
      <!-- ðŸ‘ˆ Left branch -->
      <Listing
        v-model="contacts"
        v-model:selected="selectedContact"/>

      <!-- ðŸ‘‰ Right branch -->
      <Details v-model="selectedContact"/>
    </div>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const selectedContact = ref<Contact>()

const contacts = ref<Contact[]>([{
  name: 'Charles',
  handle: '@chrlschn'
}])
</script>
```

This is the root where our state lives and we pass it down via bindings to the `Listing` and `Details` components:

```html
<!-- Snippet from Example3.vue-->
<Listing
  v-model="contacts"
  v-model:selected="selectedContact"/>

<Details v-model="selectedContact"/>
```

Let's look at `Details.vue` first:

```html
<!-- Details.vue, the right side form inputs -->
<template>
  <LabeledContainer label="Details.vue">
    <div v-if="!!selected">
      <!-- Input for the user name -->
      <label>
        Name
        <input v-model="name"/>
      </label>

      <!-- Input for the user handle -->
      <label>
        Handle
        <input v-model="handle"/>
      </label>

      <!-- Action buttons -->
      <div>
        <button @click="handleCancel">Done</button>
        <button @click="handleDone">Save</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p v-else>
      Select a contact
    </p>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const selected = defineModel<Contact|undefined>({
  required: true
})

const name = ref('')

const handle = ref('')

// When the selected value updates, we update our local copy.
watch (selected, (contact) => {
  if (!contact) {
    return
  }

  name.value = contact.name,
  handle.value = contact.handle
})

// If changes are cancelled, we revert everything.
function handleCancel() {
  selected.value = undefined
}

// If changes are saved, we update the selected object.
function handleDone() {
  if (!selected.value) {
    return
  }

  selected.value.name = name.value;
  selected.value.handle = handle.value;
}
</script>
```

This component has been written with the intent of having a set of state that gets a copy of the contact details.  When the `selected` contact changes, the component copies the values into the local state so that it can mutate the state (`name` and `handle`) without affecting the original until the user saves.  With this, the user can also cancel any edits as well.

(For larger sets of properties, consider making a full reactive copy of the object and bind directly to it instead.)

On the left hand side, the `Listing.vue` component contains a list of the contacts with the option to add a new one.

```html
<!-- Listing.vue -->
<template>
  <LabeledContainer label="Listing.vue">
    <div class="container">
      <ContactItem
        v-for="contact in contacts"
        :contact="contact"
        :selected="selected == contact"
        @click="selected = contact">
      </ContactItem>
    </div>

    <div>
      <button @click="handleAddContact"> Add contact </button>
    </div>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const contacts = defineModel<Contact[]>({
  required: true
})

const selected = defineModel<Contact|undefined>('selected', {
  required: true
})

function handleAddContact() {
  contacts.value.push({
    name: 'Name',
    handle: 'Handle'
  })
}
</script>
```

And then in `ContactItem.vue`, `Listing.vue` passes down the display values using normal `props` since there is no mutation here (and no need for two way binding):

```html
<template>
  <LabeledContainer
    label="Contact.vue"
    class="contact"
    :class="{
      'selected': !!selected
    }">
    <p class="name">{{ contact.name }}</p>
    <p class="handle">{{ contact.handle }}</p>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{
  contact: Contact,
  selected?: boolean
}>()
</script>
```

Let's see how this whole thing comes together:

![Example 3 in action](/public/img/vue34-model/example3.gif)
*Our components in action, sharing state within the hierarchy of our example component tree.*

Without `defineModel` to help simplify this interaction, it's easy to see how the instinct would be to take shortcuts or move this into global state since writing the various `emits` and `computed` would create quite a bit of friction, even in this small example!

As Billy Mays might say, "*But wait!  There's more!*"; let's take a look how it is possible to further make this code easier to understand and more manageable by using *composables*.

### Using `defineModel` with Composables

Leveraging composables can take this to the next level and further simplify our code by pulling out our state from the components.  This can be particularly useful to do when components become larger.

In Vue, this is easy to accomplish and makes refactoring and reorganizing complexity a breeze.

We simply pull our state and functions up and out of the components into another function:

```ts
// useContacts composable
export function useContacts() {
  const selectedContact = ref<Contact>()

  const contacts = ref<Contact[]>([{
    name: 'Charles',
    handle: '@chrlschn'
  }])

  function addContact() {
    contacts.value.push({
      name: 'Name',
      handle: 'Handle'
    })
  }

  return {
    selectedContact,
    contacts,
    addContact
  }
}
```

A refactored `Example3.vue` â†’ `Example4.vue` using the composables:

```html
<!-- Example4.vue -->
<template>
  <LabeledContainer label="Example4.vue">
    <h1>Example 4</h1>

    <p v-if="!!selectedContact">
      Selected: {{ selectedContact.name }} ({{ selectedContact.handle  }})
    </p>

    <div class="parent">
      <Listing
        v-model="contacts"
        v-model:selected="selectedContact"
        :add="addContact"/>

      <Details v-model="selectedContact"/>
    </div>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
// We get all of our key state from the composables instead.
const {
  selectedContact,
  contacts,
  addContact
} = useContacts()
</script>
```

It's easy to see if we wanted to move more of the logic and state out from `Details.vue`, for example, it would be easy to move the `name` and `handle` refs as well as the `handleCancel()` and `handleDone()` functions into *another composable* and share them:

```ts
// useDetailsEditor.ts

// ðŸ‘‡ Note how we receive the reactive selectedContact here so we can watch it.
export function useDetailsEditor(selectedContact: Ref<Contact|undefined>) {
  const name = ref('')

  const handle = ref('')

  // ðŸ‘‡ We add a watcher here on selectedContact so we update the encapsulated state.
  watch (selectedContact, (contact) => {
    if (!contact) {
      return
    }

    name.value = contact.name,
    handle.value = contact.handle
  })

  function cancel() {
    selectedContact.value = undefined
  }

  function done() {
    if (!selectedContact.value) {
      return
    }

    selectedContact.value.name = name.value;
    selectedContact.value.handle = handle.value;
  }

  return {
    name,
    handle,
    cancel,
    done
  }
}
```

And we update `Details.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <LabeledContainer label="Details.vue">
    <div v-if="!!selected">
      <div>
        <label>
          Name
          <input v-model="name"/>
        </label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>
          Handle
          <input v-model="handle"/>
        </label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <button @click="cancel">Done</button>
        <button @click="done">Save</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p v-else>
      Select a contact
    </p>
  </LabeledContainer>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const selected = defineModel<Contact|undefined>({
  required: true
})

const {
  name,
  handle,
  cancel,
  done
} = useDetailsEditor(selected)
// ðŸ‘† Here we pass in the selected contact so we can watch it in the composable
</script>
```

This works nicely to cleanly separate and encapsulate related state and logic by using Vue 3 composables and Vue 3.4's `defineModel` macro.  What I hope is clear is just how *easy* it is to refactor code to this pattern by simply copying out your state, functions, watchers, and computed values wholesale and pasting them into a composable.

This pattern can make even large sub-trees of components easy to manage, refactor, and test.

---

## Closing Thoughts

The introduction of `defineModel` in Vue 3.4 is actually a profound change that will help teams to follow best practices and build better, more manageable components.  By removing a lot of the friction involved in building hierarchical state, it makes it so that teams are less likely to resort immediately to global state or fall back to sloppy practices.

By combining `defineModel` with Vue composables, teams can create even cleaner components that are easy to read and understand by organizing and encapsulating related state and logic.

When Evan You first proposed the Composition API for Vue 3, there was a lot of consternation and outcry from the community that wanted to retain the simplicity and approachability of the Options API.  In retrospect, it is clear to see that the path Evan You set to help Vue scale better for teams building larger projects was the right call.  With 3.4, it feels as if that vision now feels far more complete because of how streamlined and straightforward it makes state management.  In a way, it helps add clarity to the often complex decision making process of where to place state by making the easy, obvious choice the right one.
