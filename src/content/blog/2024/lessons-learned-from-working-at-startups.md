## Summary

A collection of lessons learned from working at various startups over the years from bootstrapped startups in the enterprise commercial-off-the-shelf space to VC-backed seed/series-A/B/C stage Silicon Valley startups with non-existent/mediocre/explosive growth.

If you're somewhere in your journey with a startup as an engineer, I hope that these can be useful lessons.

## On Competitors

Having competitors is probably a good thing because it validates that there is a market of people that have a real problem to solve and will pay to solve that problem.  Within that market, then, there is a lot of room to differentiate based on price, featureset, usability, market segment, industry verticals, etc.

Rod Cuthbert -- co-founder of Viator -- makes an interesting point [in an interview with Guy Raz](https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-viator-rod-cuthbert/) (around the 01:01:00 mark):

> Because we were the first and there wasn't any competition, we were able to buy advertising and also get organic traffic relatively easily. But conversely, not having competitors was not great. When you've got competitors, you know, they bring customers into the market as well, and those customers, you know, look at their website and then a percentage of them will say, well, who else does this? What are the competitors that I can look at? So if there's other people out there who are also doing marketing, that's good for you as well. There was nobody out there who was marketing tours and activities.

Competitors are good because some of those customers want an alternative -- be it cheaper, easier to use, more focused, some use case not covered by an incumbent, etc.

Your job as a startup becomes to understand which part of the market you are going after and how you'll sell into that market.  In other words, what's your go-to-market (GTM) strategy?  NDAs have some legitimate use cases, but in most cases, you can freely tell your idea to anyone and let them poke holes in it.  If your idea is so easy to execute, then it probably wouldn't have really had any moat.

**Advice to self**: spend a good amount of time researching and understanding the other competitors in the space.  Where are there gaps?  What does the market segmentation look like?  What are people complaining about on Reddit?  Is there a specific industry or vertical where there is still an opportunity?

## On Non-Technical Co-Founders

If you are thinking about being a technical founder of a startup, the hardest challenge probably isn't technical at all; the hardest thing to do is to find the right non-technical co-founder.

The role of the CEO of a startup -- as I understand it now -- is to bring customers and book sales, secure funding, and drive the overall GTM strategy and vision of the startup as a business (how it will make money).  It's risky to form a startup with a non-technical founder without some proof or very strong evidence that they can hit those key deliverables because without cashflow, there is no business.

You don't have to see eye-to-eye on everything, but you have to have similar value systems and understanding of how to agree to disagree from time to time and still move forward.  In short, "vibes" are very important with a co-founder and it's very hard to quantify it (see *Culture* below).  You can use various tools like:

- [First Round's 50 Questions](https://proof-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/firstround/50%20Questions%20for%20Co-Founders.pdf)
- [YCombinator's 10 Questions](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/10-questions-to-discuss-with-a-potential-co-founder)
- [Founder Institute's 34 Questions](https://fi.co/insight/34-questions-to-ask-a-potential-co-founder)

**Advice to self**: ideally evaluate a non-technical co-founder by how many *paid* deals they can close without even having a product.  Can they get customers to be on a *paid* waitlist?  Can they prove that there is a market and demand with the most minimal and barebones MVP?  Make sure that you match on some key facets of value and culture.  Form the company *at the last moment possible* because this lets you really get to know the co-founder before committing equity and makes it easier to break up if something feels off.

## On MVPs

A big part of the early days of the startup is actually validating the assumptions and initial research.  When doing so, do the minimum necessary (unless you are doing it as a technical learning/exploration exercise).  The more you build, the further you'll be off course because only customer feedback (read: what someone will pay for) determines what a viable business is (this doesn't always hold true, especially for things like social media startups).

In the hierarchy of things you can do before actually building a technical MVP:

- Reach out to folks in your network if you have deep industry connections and see if you can get people to put cash down for promise for access to the upcoming product.  Don't build anything; if people will hand you money for something that doesn't even exist yet, then you've found a painful (and valuable) problem to solve.  If you can sell it with just a description, then that's amazing.  If you can sell it with a deck, also a strong signal.
- Reach out to a wider network and see if you can get people to sign up for a wait list.  If strangers will sign up for a waitlist, that's a strong signal.  A *paid waitlist*?  Lock and load.
- Build the simplest MVP possible that solves some minimum problem set that people will pay for.  AI generated is OK.  Unless you are a deep domain expert in a narrow space, it's very hard to know exactly which problem your customers need to solve and the externalities of how they want to go about solving it.
- Just book your first payments manually if you have to; don't worry about building an integration.  In fact, if your process has friction and people will still pay you, then you know you're on a very hot opportunity.
- It's OK if people complain and tell you that they won't pay you because of X, Y, Z.  They've just told you "I *would* pay, but for X, Y, Z".  Get them to commit to paying you if you solve X, Y, Z.  If you get the same X, Y, Z from multiple rejections, then the roadmap has defined itself.
- It's OK if customers churn; expect people to churn.  Don't worry about breaking things and causing customers to churn.  At Motion, customers were constantly churning early on for sometimes head-scratching reasons.  What is important is to capture the reason why they are churning.  This becomes the priority queue of problems to solve to triage the churn.

**Advice to self**: don't build anything until someone has committed to paying.  Only build if it's for fun or if the idea is so out there that you really need to see it to understand (but there's a lot of inherent risk there).  When you build, don't overbuild until it is clear what customers value ($$$).  Perfect is the enemy of shipping.

## On the Elusive Product Market Fit (PMF)

Building a startup is like building a fire with damp wood...in the rain: at some point, it's just a spark, some smoke, some smoldering embers.  It takes effort, knowledge, and skill to turn that into a self-sustaining fire.  There is a clear turning point when the effort required to grow the fire shifts and the fire simply needs to be fed with more fuel.

I think this is the best analogy I have for PMF: that bifurcation point from *building* the fire to *feeding* the fire.

**Advice to self**: every business, every market, and every team is different so there's no singular timeline or pattern for PMF.  But there will be a turning point when the type of effort required to grow the revenue stream shifts and that is when you've reached PMF.

## On Startup Culture

Culture is make-or-break when it comes to startups.  The environment can be extremely stressful at every stage and creating the right culture can help smooth rough waves and keep the team dynamics aligned.

I particularly like [an essay written by Brian Chesky](https://medium.com/@bchesky/dont-fuck-up-the-culture-597cde9ee9d4) of Airbnb fame:

> ​By upholding our core values in everything we do. Culture is a thousand things, a thousand times. It’s living the core values when you hire; when you write an email; when you are working on a project; when you are walking in the hall. We have the power, by living the values, to build the culture. We also have the power, by breaking the values, to fuck up the culture. Each one of us has this opportunity, this burden.
>
> Why is culture so important to a business? Here is a simple way to frame it. The stronger the culture, the less corporate process a company needs. When the culture is strong, you can trust everyone to do the right thing. People can be independent and autonomous. They can be entrepreneurial. And if we have a company that is entrepreneurial in spirit, we will be able to take our next “(wo)man on the moon” leap. Ever notice how families or tribes don’t require much process? That is because there is such a strong trust and culture that it supersedes any process. In organizations (or even in a society) where culture is weak, you need an abundance of heavy, precise rules and processes.
>
> There are days when it’s easy to feel the pressure of our own growth expectations. Other days when we need to ship product. Others still where we are dealing with the latest government relations issue. It’s easy to get consumed by these. And they are all very important. But compared to culture, they are relatively short-term. These problems will come and go. But culture is forever.

Write down and articulate how you want the team culture to operate and hold each other accountable to that culture.

One of the reasons I joined Motion was that I really identified with [how the founding team outlined their culture](https://motionapp.notion.site/Motion-Company-Culture-21bd766b1f864764b0db2fa72529b182). There are a couple of bangers like "disagree and commit", but honestly, every bullet there makes total sense for an early stage startup.

**Advice to self**: when founding a company, clearly establish and communicate the culture early and of course, co-founders should agree on culture.  If you hire the wrong person and it turns out that they don't fit the culture, be swift in removing them from the team because one poor fit can have a big impact on the overall vibes of the team.

## On Tech Selection

Generally, select technologies that are:

1. **Widely adopted and easy**.  I like Vue and React as SPAs for most use cases that don't require SEO.  I would personally not default to Nuxt nor Next unless the startup needed SEO.  Postgres is a great choice for backend and you can start free with Supabase.  Firestore is another great choice if you prefer document-oriented DBs since the free monthly grant is generous.
2. **Free or very low cost to use**.  This can facilitate experimentation early on without pressure.  Supabase, Firebase, Azure CosmosDB Serverless, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps.  I would avoid Lamba or Azure Functions for lock-in (unless you know that you only need AWS or Azure).  True story: at Ownit, many of our commerce customers are on Google or Azure and will not run workloads on AWS.  Cloud Run and Container Apps are particularly good for compute because containers are portable and provide the flexibility to run on-prem, in another provider, in managed K8s, etc.  Additionally, you're not limited to supported frameworks or runtimes like you would be with compute instances like Elastic Beanstalk, for example.
3. **Productive and fast to iterate**.  If you're building a web API, Rust is probably not a good choice. If you're polyglot, then pick the language, platform, and runtime framework that can let a small team move fast with the least footguns.  Productive also means "don't waste time doing non-product work" like updating/managing dependencies. C#/.NET is highly underrated in this space because of how good EF Core is for productivity and how generally stable and mature it is.

**Addendum**: don't default to NoSQL databases unless you already have a strong sense of how your data model and use cases look.  For Turas.app, it makes total sense because each itinerary is "bounded" in scope and it is easy to naturally see the document(s).  In many other use cases, a traditional relational database will be more flexible and offer less footguns.

**Advice to self**: avoid Next.js or Nuxt.js unless there is a clear need for SSG/SSR for SEO purposes.  If needed only for content site, use only for content site.  Vite + Vue/React SPA is fast to iterate, easy to deploy and manage, and low complexity.  CloudFormation is an expensive AWS tax that gets incurred on deployment; prefer Google Cloud Run or Azure Container Apps for speed of iteration and deployment.
