[A Mastodon post](https://rubber.social/@dragonarchitect/111052009808217806) got me thinking about TypeScript and why some developers end up throwing their hands up when adopting it.

My conclusion is that it starts at the very name: ‚Äú***Type***Script‚Äù and a misconception that it is simply statically typed JavaScript.

It is not.

In reality, it‚Äôs probably easier to not think about TypeScript as a programming language or even as a type system. Perhaps the easiest way to wrap your head around TypeScript is to think of it as a ***shape definition markup***.

## Understanding Type vs Shape

A simple example to highlight this is [the following code snippet](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBAShCOUC8UDeAoKWoFcCWAJgFxQDOwATngHYDmm2A9pBQIbB6PUnlV3oBfdOhrAIFAGasAxtDjwATGgZZ8xMpRr1sUZuPaduGvrQA0KqKwrSAFngBuEEgAoAlMgB8Ue40KDhEjjU0hxcUGAUjLKkpM4UCCSouIQ8mnSmuiwGXKkmAu4YOtJcpIwANhAAdGWMtM4ABgAkqPHwlWoCUM2tlXpsodQC9a7+6MXU5FAUAIzIyjpqJADkM0vmOn3ZRkusBARLo+OTFAok8nOF2ItQKwprFpsDy7v7hyXAUwDMZwhKKJeqFI3Cife4bLJPG4vMHYKy2BxOKBuTxQI7lKo1OpLACC1jsjgIAEIliMhOgIlEIDE4tMRhTorETnTIgy4p9XEA):

```ts
type Req = {
    uid: string
    operation: string
}

interface Req2 {
    uid: string
    operation: string,
    archive: () => void
}

function process(req: { uid: string, operation: string }) {
    console.log(`${req.uid} ${req.operation}`)
}

const r1 = {
    uid: 'r1',
    operation: 'add'
}

const r2: Req = {
    uid: 'r2',
    operation: 'add'
}

const r3: Req2 = {
    uid: 'r3',
    operation: 'add',
    archive: () => console.log('Archived!')
}

process(r1)
process(r2)
process(r3)
```

On **line 12**, we describe the shape of the parameter `req` to the function `process`.

When we run this code, we can see that it behaves precisely as expected:

![TS Output](/public/img/typescript/ts-shape.png)

What should be apparent looking at the function definition on **line 12** is that TypeScript is ***not*** a *static type system*; it‚Äôs actually a *shape* definition system (or more formally, a structural type system, but it's easier if you think of it as describing valid shapes).

And if we peek at the JavaScript:

```js
"use strict";
function process(req) {
    console.log(`${req.uid} ${req.operation}`);
}
const r1 = {
    uid: 'r1',
    operation: 'add'
};
const r2 = {
    uid: 'r2',
    operation: 'add'
};
const r3 = {
    uid: 'r3',
    operation: 'add',
    archive: () => console.log('Archived!')
};
process(r1);
process(r2);
process(r3);
```

It‚Äôs pretty clear why this works. You can see that in the output JavaScript, the TypeScript disappears. This is because the sole purpose of TypeScript is to inform the compiler and dev time language server about the valid *shapes*. In fact, neither Node nor the browser run TypeScript; they only interpret JavaScript.

(We'll revisit this at the end)

### TypeScript is Still Duck-Typed

![Duck Type](/public/img/typescript/duck-type.png)

> If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.

A variant of the code snippet above may help further highlight this:

![TS Req](/public/img/typescript/ts-req.png)

Note the subtle change on **line 12**: we describe the function as requiring a parameter `req` that is shaped like the type `Req` but the function will happily accept an object of the interface `Req2` precisely because TypeScript is not a type system.  In a statically typed language like C#, *this will fail* because the *type metadata* does not match, even though the shapes match (we can still achieve this in statically typed languages like C# and Java by defining type contracts like an interface or abstract base class).

With this in mind, then many of the other utility types and odd ‚Äú*type gymnastics*‚Äù makes sense: they‚Äôre all simply ways of *describing shapes* -- often in the context of other, existing shapes.

### TypeScript Utility Functions

To further emphasize this point, [consider the following example which uses the utility type `Omit<>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBAShCOUC8UDeAoKWoFcCWAJgFxQDOwATngHYDmm2A9pBQIbB6PUnlV0A0DLAGNWAGzEAjVsIDWPSjVpQA9CqgBBAgSjAAFnlJQawRrr3RSe1pHQBfdOhMQKAMxnQ48AExohuQgU+emwoZhd2Tm4yRQF-VgphAwA3CBIACgBKZAA+KGTGQntHVxxqYQ4uKDAKRmEIUlJ0-woEEgB5AFs8YAAeL34oACJRCWk5Iby1KABRAA9hMRwCaB7jajCcCjJrSChhLl5WE3RsjFCD6lJGMQgAOjFGWnSAAwASVFb4O-wCOygPl87uE2JVqHYXpliuhLuQoBQAIzIPyhX4kADkiPRglCIMiXAxrG06OhsOA8O8JC8yPO2DRUEx3mx-jxYMJxJx2FGUhk8mGemAwDApCIaggc1YnTAtzuB06Km541kQ1Jh3JFAAzFSEL4ULSsPTMRrmbiWPjouiiQQTdgEkk8KkMtkkHlYTd7o9nuiNIkUhACABCdFQhzoGp1BpNRFQ8P1RrpCjeGO1ONRjWZIA):

```ts
type Req = {
    uid: string
    operation: string,
    callback: string // Add this into the shape
}

interface Req2 {
    uid: string
    operation: string,
    archive: () => void
}

function process(
    req: Omit<Req, "callback"> // Exclude it in our shape constraint
) {
    console.log(`${req.uid} ${req.operation}`)
}

const r1 = {
    uid: 'r1',
    operation: 'add'
}

const r2: Req = {
    uid: 'r2',
    operation: 'add',
    callback: "https://example.com/callback"
}

const r3: Req2 = {
    uid: 'r3',
    operation: 'add',
    archive: () => console.log('Archived!')
}

process(r1)
process(r2)
process(r3)
```

Or alternatively, the inverse using the utility type `Pick<>`:

```ts
function process(
    req: Pick<Req, "uid" | "operation"> // Explicit shape definition
) {
    console.log(`${req.uid} ${req.operation}`)
}
```

Each is simply a different way of describing the valid shapes.  `Pick<>` and `Omit<>` are simply ways for us to derive a different shape from an existing shape.

### TypeScript Generics

[Even if we add a generic type constraint](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBAShCOUC8UDeAoKWoFcCWAJgFxQDOwATngHYDmm2A9pBQIbB6PUnlV0A0DLAGNWAGzEAjVsIDWPSjVpQA9CqgBBAgSjAAFnlJQawRrr3RSe1pHQBfdOhMQKAMxnQ48AExohuQgU+emwoZhd2Tm4yRQF-VgphAwA3CBIACgBKZAA+KGTGQntHVxxqYQ4uKDAKRmEIUlIAHgAVKAgAD2AIagIjLxz01XUtAiUoVihaHpc8YV1waGEuXlYTfwoEEgAFOdlW-igAInwCI6gAH2PwtkrqI7y1KABRDrAxObxgMmtIKAIIK4aF8ouhshhQstqKRGGIIAA6MSMWjpAAGABJUJt4PDTnYoJjsfCbpEuHZUZliugoeQoBQAIzIPyhU4kADkDLZglCJLu7NY2jZVJp3wo3hIXiZEOwrKgHO8XP8vKi-MF3Owogk0jkJCOemAwDApCIak6rAAtu8EctzSpNVIZLIjsKVqKAMwShC+FDSrCyjluxU8lik6JsgUEIPYBJJPCpDLZJB5GmwhFIlFsjSJFIQAgAQjZlIc6BqdQapHSDMppfqjUr3mrtVrFYobsyQA) (**line 13**):

It works all the same.

### Intersection Types

[Even this construct using intersection types is OK](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#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-QBmIOdG1h+0Rlj16MDIIeiNeuBdyiTGZzKBLVZQM2S4uy+UOrIsKYoWZwACEDpNvFIx1O50Y8ytJp3ZwuB46R5OJ-3HcWQA):

```ts
type Identifiable = {
    uid: string
}

type Instruction = {
    operation: string,
    params: string[]
}

type Req = {
    uid: string
    operation: string,
    callback: string // Add this into the shape
}

interface Req2 {
    uid: string
    operation: string,
    archive: () => void
}

function process<T extends Identifiable & Instruction>( // Defining the shape using an intersection type
    req: Pick<T, "uid" | "operation"> // Explicit shape definition
) {
    console.log(`${req.uid} ${req.operation}`)
}
```

TypeScript happily accepts it all because our shapes still match.

### There is no ~~Spoon~~ Type

![Matrix no spoon](/public/img/typescript/no-spoon.jpg)

Remember that JavaScript we saw earlier?

```ts
function process(req: Req) {
    console.log(`${req.uid} ${req.operation}`)

    if ( /* req is Req type */ ) {
        // Do Req specific thing
    } else {
        // Do other thing
    }
}
```

One of the most common misunderstandings that arises is when developers want to perform different branching logic based on the *type* in the TypeScript code.  Because the resultant JavaScript carries no actual type metadata, this simply doesn't work.  It is often confusing for developers coming from statically typed language systems like C# where it *does* work.

The reason this is worth highlighting is to really emphasize the purpose of TypeScript: to inform the dev time language server and the compiler about the valid shapes -- nothing more.

## Conclusion

If you‚Äôre a developer throwing your hands up with TypeScript, the first thing to do is to probably ignore the ‚ÄúType‚Äù part of the name and perhaps think of it as ‚ÄúShapeDef‚Äù ü§£; you‚Äôre describing the valid shapes to the language server at dev time, the compiler at compile time, and for the sanity of your fellow dev team.  TypeScript is not a statically typed programming language; TypeScript is JavaScript with shape definitions.

The second thing to do is to pick up [Adam Freeman‚Äôs *Essential TypeScript*](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-TypeScript-4-Beginner-Pro/dp/148427010X) book (not an affiliate link; it‚Äôs just a great book). This is hands down one of the best technical books I have in my possession and a great book for any developer that wants to do TypeScript well.

What I hope is clear from these short examples is that thinking of TypeScript as a programming language or as a static type system will ultimately create a mental hurdle to understanding how to use this shape definition system to write safer JavaScript.
